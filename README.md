# Calculator-Test
A basic calculator app built with JavaScript and HTML/CSS, so that it can be reached from any device with a web browser.

Features:
---------
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide; Small or large numbers. Displays anything more than 21 digits in scientific notation.
- Supports negative numbers using the '-+' button. 
- Repeat a calculation on the output of the previous calculation, just press '=' again.
- All calculations are saved and able to be viewed in the log, in the order of most recent first. Negative numbers are logged within parenthesis.
- UI customization settings; Change color or font to any of the included presets.

Ways The App Could Be Improved Further:
---------------------------------------
- Support for longer expressions to be solved in the order of operations. It currently solves in the order of what is entered.
- A way to save or download the log. The app is currently static, a page refresh will reset everything.
- I'm sure there is a 'cleaner' way to write a calculator. However I did not want to follow any tutorials and the current code is just what I came up with first.
