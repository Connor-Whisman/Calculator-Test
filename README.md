# Calculator-Test
A basic calculator app built with JavaScript and HTML/CSS, so that it can be reached from any device with a web browser.

Features:
---------
- Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide; Small or large numbers. Displays anything more than 21 digits in scientific notation.
- Supports negative numbers using the '-+' button. 
- Repeat a calculation on the output of the previous calculation, just press '=' again.
- All calculations are saved and able to be viewed in the log, in the order of most recent first. Negative numbers are logged within parenthesis.
- UI customization settings; Change color or font to any of the included presets.

Ways The App Could Be Improved Further:
---------------------------------------
- Support for longer expressions to be solved in the order of operations. It currently solves in the order of what is entered.
- A way to save or download the log. The app is currently static, a page refresh will reset everything.
- In hindsight, I feel that an object-oriented approach may have led to some 'cleaner' code.

Resources Used:
---------------
- JavaScript Documentation: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript
- W3 Schools (HTML & CSS): https://www.w3schools.com/
- CSS active buttons for mobile: https://blog.tomoyukikashiro.me/post/how-to-set-active-style-to-button-in-mobile
- For testing, I used Google Chrome's DevTools as well as iPhone devices. I unfortunately did not have access to testing on any type of Android device.

Accessing The Calculator:
-------------------------
My Calculator-Test app is currently being hosted as a static web app through Microsoft Azure. I figured this would be the best way for everyone to see it on any device.
If you would like to view it on a desktop using the source code, just download the github repo and open the index.html file in the browser of your choice.

In Conclusion:
--------------
I really enjoyed putting this project together! It seems like it would be pretty simple at first, but it definitely tested my skills in more than one way. I think the biggest thing I've learned from it, is that it's time to learn a front-end framework for my web developement projects. I've begun to read up on React.js and am looking forward to being knowledgeable in how the modern-day, front-end developer approches things.
